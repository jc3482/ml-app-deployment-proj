Remove baking sheet from broiler and use a spatula to turn pineapple pieces over. Arrange shrimp in a single layer on empty half of baking sheet. Broil until shrimp are cooked through on top, about 2 minutes. Remove from broiler and turn shrimp (leave pineapple alone). Broil again until shrimp are cooked through, 12 minutes. Transfer shrimp and pineapple to a large bowl and season with more salt and pepper. Drain soaking liquid from onion into bowl with shrimp and pineapple; set onion aside and toss shrimp and pineapple in pickling liquid. Serve shrimp mixture with tortillas, avocado, jalapeo, cilantro, lime wedges, and reserved pickled onion for making tacos.\n",
